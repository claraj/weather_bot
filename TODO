Not possible to create/write files on server with standard python method. Log all temp data to file on server?

emoji snowflake in status message - chewed by tweepy?

correctly use skip_files in app.yaml to ignore /out directory.  and venv directory.

(the lib directory must be uploaded to GAE, but needs not be in github. )

Tweepy will not post duplicate Tweets. What to do if the same city and same temp is the lowest two days in a row?


(create requirements: pip freeze > requirements.txt )

(Install from requirements)

pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib/

Tests


admin only route to tweet



notes: needs billing enabled for tweepy, for SSL support
Tweepy also doesn't work in devserver

Task queue HTTP method defaults to POST
cron job defaults to GET
